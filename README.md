# GraphicsExample

This is Code taken from coursework I completed on my masters degree.

It is based on the provided NCLGL framework, although throughout the coursework many files were added or altered in that framework. 


To run code use "GraphicsTutorials.sln". Code may not work without an nvidea graphics card.
